# Interactive Game Show App 

A browser based word guessing game called "Phrase Hunter", which challenges the user to figure out a hidden phrase. 

## How it works? 

I used JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming to select a random/hidden phrase, which the player tries to guess by clicking on the onscreen keyboard. 

## Game Rules 

1. If a letter is correct, it appears on the board. 

2. if a letter is NOT correct, the player loses a heart point. 

3. When all heart points (5 in total) are lost, the player loses the game.
